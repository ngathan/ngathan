### Hi, I'm Nga ðŸ‘‹


I'm a sociologist and a computational social scientist. I use computational tools to analyze and understand social problems. I write about AI ethics and Sociology at [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai/the-sociology-of-ai-ethics-column-introduction/). 

- ðŸŽ“ I am a doctoral candidate in sociology at CUNY - The Graduate Center.
- ðŸŽ“ I'll be teaching Quantitative Research Methods at Hunter College in Spring 2021.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently doing research that applies Machine Learning in social sciences, and I write about ethical considerations of Machine Learning systems in solving social problems. 
- ðŸŒ±  I read a lot of novels.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on introducing sociological concepts in machine learning designs, and how sociological reflexivity helps tackle bias, and fairness problems in ML.  
- ðŸ˜… Fun fact: I speak four languages and love learning new languagea. My current target language is Hindi. 


The best way to reach me is through email. I'm open to collaborations, and idea exchanges.
