### Hi, I'm Nga ðŸ‘‹


I'm a sociologist and a computational social scientist. I use computational tools to analyze and understand social problems. I write about AI ethics and Sociology at [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai/the-sociology-of-ai-ethics-column-introduction/). 

- ðŸŽ“ I am a doctoral candidate in sociology at [CUNY - The Graduate Center](http://gc.cuny.edu/).
- ðŸŽ“ I'll be teaching Quantitative Research Methods at [Hunter College](https://hunter.cuny.edu/) in Spring 2021.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently doing research that applies Machine Learning in social sciences, and I write about ethical considerations of Machine Learning systems in solving social problems. 
- :books: I read a lot of novels. My favs lately are [Pachinko](https://www.minjinlee.com/book/pachinko/), and [Everything Here Is Beautiful](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/548173/everything-here-is-beautiful-by-mira-t-lee/). 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on introducing sociological concepts in machine learning designs, and how sociological reflexivity helps tackle bias, and fairness problems in ML.  
- ðŸ˜… Fun fact: I speak four languages and love learning new ones. My current target language is Hindi. 


The best way to reach me is through email. I'm open to collaborations, and idea exchanges.
