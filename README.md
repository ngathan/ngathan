### Hi, I'm Nga ðŸ‘‹


I'm a sociologist and a computational social scientist. I use computational tools to analyze social phenomena, and understand social problems. I write about AI ethics and Sociology at [Sociology and AI](https://montrealethics.ai/the-sociology-of-ai-ethics-column-introduction/). 

ðŸŽ“ I am a doctoral candidate in sociology at CUNY - The Graduate Center.
ðŸŽ“ I'll be teaching Quantitative Research Methods at Hunter College in Spring 2021.
ðŸ”­ I'm currently doing research and writing papers on applied Machine Learning in social sciences, and ethical considerations of Machine Learning systems in solving social problems. 
ðŸŒ±  I read a lot especially novels. If you have a recommendation, send it my way. 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on how to introduce sociological concepts in machine learning designs, and how sociological reflexivity helps ML engineers tackle biases, and fairness problems. 
ðŸ˜… Fun fact: I lived in Germany for two years after college, learned German deligently during the time. When I have free time, I prefer to learn a new real language. My current target language is Hindi. 

The best way to reach me is through email. I'm open to collaborations, and idea exchanges.
